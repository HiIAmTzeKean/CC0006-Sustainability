# Renewable energy
## Method
- Solar energy
    - Solar thermal system for direct heating
    - Concentrated solar thermal to create steam to generate electricity
    - Passive solar heating â†’ Heating of building
    - Solar photovoltaics
- Wind energy
    - Wind turbines on land or offshore
        - Wind speed is higher near water body but tends to be more expensive
- Hybrid of solar and wind
    - Solar when there is light
    - Strong winds at night
    - Both complements each other
## Benefits
- Never runs out
- Reduces [[Greenhouse gas]] emission
- Monetary saving
- Employment generation
    - Creating new jobs for others with fossil fuel plants shutdown
    - Creating green jobs
- Can be decentralised
    - Supports remote locations which needs energy
- Resilient to market fluctuations
    - Good for countries that are dependent on energy imports
## Challenges
- Intermittent energy source
    - A need for energy storage like battery which adds to cost
    - Grid parity â†’ Cost of generation from renewable source same as conventional source
- Large land area required
    - Innovation required
    - Generation of energy in neighbouring countries
- Social acceptance
    - Public sceptical
    - Governments also need to change mindset
## Situation
- Adoption is increasing but low at 30% of total electricity generation
