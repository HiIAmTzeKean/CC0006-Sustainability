# Greenhouse gas

## Types
- 6 major GHG
    - CO2
    - Methane
    - Nitrous Oxide
    - 3 fluorinated gas

## Factor considerations
- Lifetime of gas
- Concentration
- Potential to trap heat
    - Methane is higher than CO2

## CO2
- It traps heat to keep earth warm
- The more CO2 in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet
- The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon
- The optimal temperature is 18 degree for human life
- We cannot live without GHG as it will be too cold
- Our growth through use of burning fuels is artificially increasing the GHG
- Has the longest lifetime compared to other GHG
- Main driver of [[Climate change]]

## Drivers of GHG
- Burning of fossil fuel for electricity
    - Greatest driver due to high composition of carbon
