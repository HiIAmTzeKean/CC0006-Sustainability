# Noise pollution

## Challenges
- Higher noise related complains
    - Few of these activities were breaking the law (90 decibels for 5minutes)
- Average outdoor noise level are higher than prescribed limit
    - 69.4 decibels compared to recommended 67 per hour
    - Noisy restates are usually mature estate with higher road density and enclosed building design can trap sound
    - Can reach levels of 78 decibels
- Prolong exposure can cause
    - Cardiovascular disease
    - Stress and anxiety
    - Risk of adverse non-auditory health effects
        - Metabolic effect, mental health for long term
        - Hypertension
- Lound prolong sound
    - Physical damage to inner epithelia cells of ear
    - Healthy ear has a structure called cochlea with many hair cell, but can be damaged by loud sound
    - Hearing loss, tinnitus 
- Noisy natural landscape
    - Aquatic animals and terrestrial animals affected
        - Artificial sound created by humans can alter acoustic
        - Population and diversity of birds can decline or change when exposed to continuous noise by urban environment
        - Difficult to hear, find food, locate mate and avoid predator
        - Impair navigation and communication
    - Cetaceans are vulnerable to noise pollution from sonar beams
        - Shipping traffic and seismic survey can cause hearing loss to animals
        - Sound travels faster and longer and in water
        - High energy sound can interfere with animals sonar and navigation
## Strategies
- Anti-control noise window
    - Emit anti-sound to reduce noise pollution
    - Open window design reduce heating in apartment
    - More time is needed for development
- Establish quiet area
- Develop quieter ship, cars and plants
- Reduce traffic speed limit, build noise reduction barrier
- Environmental assessment before building houses with follow up assessments
