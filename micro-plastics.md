    - Wash down drain and slip through water plants to enter the ocean
- **Secondary microplastics** are those that break down over time
    - Originate from large plastic material
    - Abrasion, wind or sunrays that break it down
    - Paints, adhesive, electronics components are some examples that can create to microplastics
    - Washing clothes used in washing machines used commonly in households are also a contributor as well
- Prominent everywhere even in the Artic and Antarctic
    - Mariana trench, the world's deepest place contained even plastic bags and candy wrapping
    - Found even in our food
- Can serve as home to marine life
    - Zooplankton, birds and crabs
- Bio-accumulation through ingestion
    - Makes way up the food chain
    - Makes it way into out water, and even honey
    - Humans consume a lot of microplastics
    - But the impact on human is still not know nor proven. But could increase exposure to plasticiser that are known to be harmful
- Negative effects to marine life
    - Can impair reproductive system
    - Stunt growth and diminish appetite
    - Tissue inflammation and liver damage
