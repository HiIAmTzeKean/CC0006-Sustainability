# Energy and climate change

- Increasing number of people in the world
- Increasing [[GDP]] of every country in the world
## Challenges
- High demand for growth with unequal distribution of wealth
    - [[GDP#Challenges]]
- High demand for growth damages the environment
    - Dependent on environment for survival
    - Overexploitation is hurting the environment which has long term effects
- [[Greenhouse gas]] damaging the environment
    - Measured by ppm
    - IPCC aims to increase knowledge on environmental impacts for humans
    - [[Greenhouse gas#CO2]]
    - Temperature increased by 1 degree since industrialisation
        - Effects are numerous and attributed to things like climate change, extreme weather, reduction of ice cover
        - Have disastrous impact to human in terms of food and water supply
- Effects of global warming
    - Natural disaster killed many and cost society money
    - [[Climate change]] is increasing the intensity and frequency of these disasters
    - Impacts both poor and rich countries
- [[Energy poverty]]
## Strategy
- IPCC recommends limit increase in temperature to 1.5 instead of 1.1 degree
    - Long lasting and irreversible damages once crossed
    - Lost of forest and diversity
    - Forest acts as a carbon sink to absorb CO2, current increase in temperature is causing forest to instead emit more CO2
- Halting industrial activities is not feasible
    - Many are still suffering and economic growth is key to alleviate these sufferings
    - Generation of electricity is also not the core reason why there is more GHG, it is use of carbon based source â†’ seeking [[Renewable energy]] can be a option
- [[Emission mitigation]] and Adaptation ([[Climate resilience]])
    - Mitigation to reduce [[Climate change]]
    - Adaptation to keep ourselves safe and buy time as we change
        - Flood defences
        - Protecting crops from droughts
- Policy adoption
    - Regulation can helps accelerate adoption and decarbonization
    - Incentives to drive behaviour change
## Question
1. The world population growth has slow in recent times
    1. True
2. [[GDP]] is used to measure size of economy, performance and growth
    1. True
3. We are more prosperous than ever before in terms of wealth
    1. True. This is from the rise in GDP over the years
4. Which [[Greenhouse gas]] is the main driver of [[Climate change]]
    1. CO2, taking into account of lifetime, concentration and heating effect
5. Total [[Greenhouse gas]] usually represented by CO2
    1. True, it is seen as the main GHG
6. Once all emission mitigation measures are in place, we can discard our adaption plans
    1. False. They both work together to provide greater resilience to [[Climate change]] and to reduce overall impact of emissions. GHG also tends to remain for many years, it takes time to see improvements.
