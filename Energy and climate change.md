# Energy and climate change

- Increasing number of people in the world
- Increasing [[GDP]] of every country in the world
## Challenges
- High demand for growth with unequal distribution of wealth
    - [[GDP#Challenges]]
- High demand for growth damages the environment
    - Dependent on environment for survival
    - Overexploitation is hurting the environment which has long term effects
- [[Greenhouse gas]] damaging the environment
    - Measured by ppm
    - IPCC aims to increase knowledge on environmental impacts for humans
    - [[Greenhouse gas#CO2]]
    - Temperature increased by 1 degree since industrialisation
        - Effects are numerous and attributed to things like climate change, extreme weather, reduction of ice cover
        - Have disastrous impact to human in terms of food and water supply
- Effects of global warming
    - Natural disaster killed many and cost society money
    - [[Climate change]] is increasing the intensity and frequency of these disasters
    - Impacts both poor and rich countries
- [[Energy poverty]]
## Strategy
- IPCC recommends limit increase in temperature to 1.5 instead of 1.1 degree
    - Long lasting and irreversible damages once crossed
    - Lost of forest and diversity
    - Forest acts as a carbon sink to absorb CO2, current increase in temperature is causing forest to instead emit more CO2
- Halting industrial activities is not feasible
    - Many are still suffering and economic growth is key to alleviate these sufferings
    - Generation of electricity is also not the core reason why there is more GHG, it is use of carbon based source â†’ seeking [[Renewable energy]] can be a option
- [[Emission mitigation]] and Adaptation ([[Climate resilience]])
    - Mitigation to reduce [[Climate change]]
    - Adaptation to keep ourselves safe and buy time as we change
        - Flood defences
        - Protecting crops from droughts
- Policy Instruments & adoption
    - [[Institution based policy]]
    - [[Regulatory based policy]]
    - [[Market based tool policy]]
    - [[Non-market mechanism policy]]
    - Regulation can helps accelerate adoption and decarbonization
    - Incentives to drive behaviour change
- International collaboration
    - [[UNFCCC]]
    - [[Kyoto Protocol]]
    - [[Paris agreement]]
- Economic challenge of estimation
    - It is difficult to quantify [[Climate change]] impacts
        - What is the cost of suffering ?
        - How much would it cost us now and in the future ?
- Emissions are not equal
    - Developed countries are emitting substantially more (China, USA. India)
    - Developing countries make up a small fraction of emission
    - Most of the developing countries emissions are to fuel [[Consumerism]] in developed countries
    - European countries with oil resources are huge emitters
## Question
1. The world population growth has slow in recent times
    1. True
2. [[GDP]] is used to measure size of economy, performance and growth
    1. True
3. Which sector contributes most to GHG. (a ) Agriculture and Forestry b ) Transportation c ) Industry d ) Electricity and Heat Production)
    1. Electricity and Heat Production
4. We are more prosperous than ever before in terms of wealth
    1. True. This is from the rise in GDP over the years
5. Which [[Greenhouse gas]] is the main driver of [[Climate change]]
    1. CO2, taking into account of lifetime, concentration and heating effect
6. Total [[Greenhouse gas]] usually represented by CO2
    1. True, it is seen as the main GHG
7. Once all emission mitigation measures are in place, we can discard our adaption plans
    1. False. They both work together to provide greater resilience to [[Climate change]] and to reduce overall impact of emissions. GHG also tends to remain for many years, it takes time to see improvements.
8. What is carbon sequestration?
    1. The process of capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground or in other long-term storage facilities. Refer to [[Emission mitigation]] carbon capture and storage
9. What is the main cause of deforestation
    1. [[Agriculture]]
10. What is the name of the process by which heat is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere?
    1. Greenhouse effect
11. Which of the following is not a type of renewable energy source? a ) Wind power b ) Hydroelectric power c ) Nuclear power d ) Geothermal power
    1. Nuclear power
12. Which of the following is a benefit of using wind power? a) It produces no greenhouse gas emissions b) It is not affected by weather conditions c) It has a low upfront cost d) It requires very little land area
    1. It produces no greenhouse gas emissions
