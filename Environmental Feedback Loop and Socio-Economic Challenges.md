# Environmental Feedback Loop and Socio-Economic Challenges

- Climate tipping point
- [[Climate change]] from high [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] by humans
- Negative feedback loop
    - Net loss of ice mass
    - Less high-albedo surface to reflect sun rays
    - Positive feedback loop to increase temperature
- Strong triggers can create positive feedbacks
    - When the trigger is strong enough, it cross the tipping point
    - Accelerates events
- Usually these triggers do not happen overnight
    - Gradual change that can be detected
