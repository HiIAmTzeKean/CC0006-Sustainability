# Purchasing power parity

A different exchange rate compared the the normal foreign exchange rate. It is a theoretical rate at which you can buy the same basket of goods and services with another currency.

## Method
A basket of goods is determined and calculated in its respective currency. The price of every other currency is then calculated by estimating how much is needed to be paid in the country for the same basket.
