# Market based tool policy

- Cap and trade
- To allow reduction of [[Greenhouse gas]] at lowest cost possible
    - Cap limits the allowable emission
    - The legal binding and right to trade openly makes it a market based tool (that is subjected to demand and supply)
    - Corporates emitting below their threshold sells
    - Corporate emitting above their threshold buys to cover the shortfall
