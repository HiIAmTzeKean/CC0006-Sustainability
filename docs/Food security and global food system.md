# Food security and global food system

> When people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food for their diet.

[[World food program]]

## Dimensions of food security
- Stability
    - Resilience in food supply
- Utilisation
    - Use of resources to generate food
- Availability
    - Import and export of food
- Accessibility
    - Distribution of food in fair manner

## Challenges
- Armed conflict
    - Most of the hunger stems from war forcing these people to lose access to food and nutrition
    - Identified as "single greatest challenge" to solve world hunger
- [[Climate change]] affecting agriculture
    - Agriculture is a major source of GHG which drives [[Climate change]]
    - Animals which produce methane
    - Sea level water rise causing salinity issue. Flood and water logging or droughts are also other issues.
    - Overall these impacts can reduce crop yield
- Rising food demand from increased population
    - Already have food shortage that is not yet fixed, but number of capital expected to further increase
    - Rich people consumes more (50% more consumption per pax than in past)
    - 2 problems that have to be tackled, increase people, increase food per pax
- Increased meat demand in [[Agriculture]]
    - Cause of cancer when overconsumed
    - Major contributor to GHG
    - More impact compared to plant based food on global warming
    - Impact stems mainly from deforestation and loss of carbon from soil. Factors like transport and storage are not as significant
- Eradicating hunger
- Ensuring proper nutrition
    - 22% of children's growth were stunted
- Reducing environmental impact
    - Largest cause of biodiversity loss
    - High freshwater usage
    - Loading of nutrients and pollution from pesticide
    - Soil erosion and degradation

## Strategies
- Minimal use of land
    - In the past large use of land space and fertilizers causes environmental issue
- Sustainable agriculture methods
- Shift diet to plant based food
    - There is energy loss through energy pyramid
    - Plant food more energy efficient in terms of maximising energy transfer to humans
    - The land area used by crop production is much smaller than production for livestock. About 7% vs 27%.
- Food technologies
    - Lab grown meat
    - Results are currently promising and could aid in reducing GHG production and land use
- Reduce food waste
    - High food wastage suggest that these food could be use to support world hunger
    - Circular economy through conversion of waste for nutrition
    - Closed food loop, there is no end of product life

## Singapore case
- Diversifying supply
    - Importing eggs from multiple countries to buffer against disruptions
- Local production
    - Use of food technology
    - Lab grown artificial meat
- Expansion of local companies overseas

## Global food system
- Connections of production and consumption
- Comprised of many actors who participate (people, institutions)

## Current agri-food sector
- Largest economic sector
- Employs half global workforce
    - Many are farmers and fishermen
- High greenhouse emission
- Uses a lot of freshwater and damages marine and terrestrial life
- Profit at expense of environment

## Questions
1. The number of under-nourished children is steadily increasing
    1. True. More than half of all under-nourished people are found in Asia
2. There is some link between war and food security
    1. True. [[World food program]] emphasised how they affect each other.
3. War and armed conflict is the single greatest challenge to achieve zero-hunger
    1. True. Many of the hungry are living in such conditions due to war.
4. Agriculture is a major source of GHG
    1. Yes, it takes up around 24% of GHG emissions
5. Climate change does not directly threaten food production
    1. False. It directly and indirectly threaten food production, especially for the poor countries
6. What are some examples of climate effects on agriculture
    1. Salinity issues, water logging, drought
7. Food security has 4 dimensions
    1. True
8. Importing food as the only strategy is a good way to ensure food security
    1. False. It makes the country susceptible to market changes and over reliant on external factors
9. The agri-food sector is the world's largest food sector
    1. True. Employs half the global work force.
10. People tend to consumer more food as they become more wealthy
    1. True
11. Meat and dairy products tend to have larger impact on global warming
    1. True. Compared to plant counterparts, meat generate more GHG. The same cannot be said about other factors like pollution.
12. In general vegetables can feed more people than meat
    1. True, based on the energy pyramid, less energy is lost. This means that humans would need to consume less to sustain themselves.
13. Shift to plant based diet could mean overall lower land usage for agriculture
    1. Assuming the total population and energy demand stays the same, it is likely to be true. Humans would need to consume less plants than meat to sustain life, thus there is likely to be an overall decrease in land use for agriculture.
