# Plastic pollution

## Benefits
- Help food stay fresh longer
- Light weighted â†’ fuel saving
## Challenges
- White pollution
    - Single use white plastic bag or table utensil disposal
    - Usage can be measured in weeks or months
    - Persists for 100 of years. Exist as functional product or landfills or littering the environment
    - Many end up in ocean
- Great pacific garbage patch
    - Marine debris spanning from North America to Japan
    - North pacific gyre of large ocean currents
    - Gyre formed by 4 currents rotating clockwise pushes the plastic around
    - Plastics are not biodegradable break down into [[micro-plastics]]
    - Most of the plastic waste come from land sources, remaining from boats
    - Synthetic plastic fishing nets made of half of the mass of the patch
- Accumulation of plastics in food chain
    - [[Nano-plastics]], [[micro-plastics]]
    - Meso-plastic 1mili-metre to 1 centi-metre
    -  Can go through environmental process through agglomeration with other particles to accumulate in different environment
- Currently no standardised approach
    - No internationally agreed protocol to measure impact of plastic
    - [[UNEP]]
        - Using citizen science data as primary source of information
        - Citizen scientist are encourage to quantify and monitor trends
        - The threat of plastic pollution still not legally recognised by most
- Responsibility is key
    - Recycling is not the answer but corporates are still advocating recycling as priority to avoid bearing the cost
    - Requires reduced use of single-use packaging
    - Focus on product design and change business model
- Sachet-economy
    - Small sachet of soap and food have big impact of plastic pollution
    - Only small fraction recycled
    - Prominent in developing country an d high growth country
