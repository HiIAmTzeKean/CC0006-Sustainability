# Income equality
## Measures
- [[Gini coefficient]]

## Historic driving forces
- Race
- Ethnic
- Gender
    - Women earning less than men
- Social

## Forces widening the gap
- Skills and education
    - Seems good, but a person will have more advanced skill than others â†’ higher wage than those less skilled
- Technology
- Political influence
    - Use wealth to lobby for favourable policies for the rich
- Redistribution policies
    - Social transfer and public retirement benefits, but are not using it effectively
    - High income household enjoying even lower tax rates
