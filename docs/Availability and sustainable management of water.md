# Availability and sustainable management of water

- Water is essential for survival but is limited in resource
- Water is seen as a human right

## Major concerns
- 17 countries facing high baseline water stress
- Unsustainable use of water
    - [[Pollution]] and excessive water withdrawal
- Ownership of water still not decided
- [[Climate change]] can make water supply less predictable
- Unaffordable and inaccessibility to water
    - Handwashing foregone due to clean water shortage
    - Priority of consumption over hygiene
- [[Water pollution]]
- Greater competition for water
    - [[Agriculture]] uses the most water but there is current insufficient funds to maintain good irrigation
    - World bank propose water to be treated as economic good â†’ financial instruments to generate saving and revenue
    - Economic allow analysis of demand and supply to optimise allocation, but it does not capture and reflect how developing country manages their water
    - New policies are needed to protect interest for each country
- Scarcity in urban areas due to [[Hydrological]] change
    - Families must spend excessively to buy water, forcing them to cut back on spending
    - Some may sacrifice health and consume unsafe ground water
    - [[Climate change]] will drive this issue even further
- Transboundary conflict
    - Future wars could be over water
    - Most water conflicts are currently intra-state
    - Downstream nations are suffering from actions by upstream nation
    - Water diversion issue can cause many to lose access to water

## Strategy
- Find ways to work with finite resource
- Multiple actors are involved
- Can leverage on [[water security and sustainable development framework]]

## SDG 6
- Access to adequate and sanitisation for all
- Water quality through reduced pollution
- Improve water efficiency
- Drives success in SDG 3, 11, 12, 15 as well

## Singapore case
- Singapore is ranked lowly for natural water resources
    - Due to small land area to capture and store water
    - Not due to poor rainfall
- Singapore water demand rising
    - Expected that non-domestic sector using more water progressively
    - New water and desalination to meet most of water demand
- Singapore 4 national taps
    - Capturing rain water in local catchments
        - Creating more water catchments in both forested and urbanised catchments
        - Stormwater collection system â†’ cleaner storm water is channelled into the reservoir
        - Barrage in Marina through 5 rivers across city centre to meet before water enters the sea
        - Total of 17 reservoir created for large scale water harvesting
    - [[Desalination]]
    - Filtration ([[NEWater]])
    - Imported water
        - Dependent on Johor for water supply
        - May not always be reliable as water will be dependent on state of other country
        - Minimise amount of water supplied from imports by 2061
- 3 Cs to manage water
    - Challenges
    - Capacity
    - Cost
- Singapore deep tunnel sewerage system
    - To enhance water system in Singapore
    - Free up land for high value uses (DTSS will free about 50% of land)
- Policy and mindset
    - Changing water habits through pricing to reflect supply
    - Pricing strategies to encourage water conservation
    - Water labelling efficiency scheme for more informed choices
- [[Climate change]] on Singapore
    - Vulnerable to dry spell and eutrophication
    - High flood risk

## Question
- Is water a human right?
    - Yes, everyone should have access to sufficient and safe supply of water for consumption
- Why is clean water important for survival
    - Crucial for hand washing, and hygiene is important to reduce spread of diseases
- Many living in rural areas still lack access to sanitation and clean water
    - True
- Why is access to clean water and sanitation important
    - Effective in preventing and containing diseases
- Most water conflicts are currently intra-state
    - True
- Climate change could drive greater water conflict globally
    - True, transboundary conflicts are likely to increase due to diminishing fresh water supply
