# Gini coefficient

- Measures distribution within group
     - Lower is better
     - Poor country tend to have high Gini coefficient
     - Ironically, developed countries like America also have high Gini coefficient
- Short comings
    - Does not indicate overall wealth or wellbeing of country
    - High income and low income country can have the same Gini coefficient, but  it does not mean the lower bracket in both country have similar wellbeing
    - What about when everyone is equally poor?
