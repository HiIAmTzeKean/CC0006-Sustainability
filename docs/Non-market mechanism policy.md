# Non-market mechanism policy

- Carbon tax
- Emitting 25 kilo-ton of CO2 must pay a fee
- Cost of pollution is absorbed by the producer and consumers
    - Tax will lead to higher cost â†’ consumers will consume less or switch to suppliers using [[Renewable energy]] and charges a lower cost
    - Producers will also be incentivised to switch to cleaner alternatives to lower their COGS
- Governments will also receive tax revenue
    - Can fund green projects, offset higher cost for consumers to ensure equity
