# Sustainable cities

>[!quote] City that manages all resourcesâ€¦ that guarantee the well-being of current and future generationsâ€¦ distributional equity

## Current situation
- Rising proportion of urban population
- Greater land used for urbanisation
    - More land used for built up cities â†’ Other sectors will have less land resources
    - But cities tend to occupy very little land (Approximately 1%)
    - However, cities contribute heavily to [[Climate change]] due to high energy usage fuelled by carbon fuel
- Increasing number living in large cities
    - [[Megacities]] are growing in Asia and Africa
    - There are cities shrinking in US and Europe
- Urban population tend to have higher living standards
    - Electricity access, water and sanitation, clean fuel
    - Better lifestyle that can lead to more consumption
## Challenges
- Rising urban poverty
    - Slum dwellers who lack access to basic services
    - 33% of urban population
- Housing vs [[Agriculture]]
    - Urban farming?
- Environmental challenges
    - Greater waste generation from higher consumption
    - Air and water pollution
    - Cities are dependent on the environment to provide [[Ecosystem services]]
- High energy consumption
    - Cities account for about 70% of energy consumption and generate 70% of GHG â†’ High impact
    - Contributes to climate change through high energy usage which results in higher [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emission
- Vulnerable to [[Climate change]]
    - Natural hazards, [[Urban heat island effect]], [[Urban flooding]]
    - People and infrastructure are more concentrated and more prone to impact
- [[Donut economics]]

## Singapore case
- WWF collects these data and gives short examples how countries uses the guidelines to develop solutions for their own cities
- International Standard Organisation
    - ISO with sustainability dimension
- Singapore green plan 2030
    - Singapore had a prior Sustainability blueprint which was very comprehensive
## SDG goal
- Reduce environmental impact of cities
    - Paying attention to air quality and wate management
- Access to safe, inclusive and accessible public spaces
- Link urban, peri-urban and rural area
## Strategy
- Sound urban planning
    - Provide incentives or policies to increase number of sustainable building
    - Green mark certificate building in Singapore
    - Good public transport system to reduce GHG from cars
- Reduction in waste and emission
    - [[Renewable energy]] integration in buildings
- Resilience to disaster
    - Disaster management plan
- [[Blue and green infrastructure]]
- Countering solutionism
    - The thinking that technology can solve everything (problems can be easily solved)
    - Time and energy to derive solution and there is no one unique solution
- Cities are not all bad
    - There are some challenges that arise as cities grow, but the benefits are numerous too
    - Changing individual behaviour such as public transport to reduce car usage
